                Kratix is a framework for building composable internal developer platforms (IDPs). 
                Kratix enables platform teams to offer everything(X)-as-a-service to enable developers to ship code faster, safer, and at scale.
                
                The three core components of Kratix are Promises, Workflows, and Fleet Management.                 
                A Kratix Promise is an API contract between the Platform and its users. Kratix Workflows define reusable actions (and "aspects") that hook into the Promise lifecycle. 
                Kratix implements fleet management using GitOps principles to continually reconcile desired cluster and platform states.

                Kratix acts as a platform orchestrator, integrating and acting as the glue between app management UX (portals, APIs, CLI) and infrastructure as code (IaC).
                In addition to providing the ability to create platform/service APIs via Promises, Kratix also manages the lifecycle of the platform itself, supporting day 1, day 2, and day 2000 operations.

                KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge.It is built upon
                kubernetes and provides fundamental infrastructure support for network, application deployment and metadata synchronization between cloud and
                edge.

                Our goal is to make an open platform to enable Edge computing, extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at
                Edge
              summary_business_use_case: >
                KubeEdge has found widespread adoption across multiple industries, including transportation, energy, internet, CDN, manufacturing, and smart
                campuses. Some of the notable use cases include:

                Tiansuan Constellation Program: KubeEdge has been integrated into the cloud-native satellite computing platform initiated by the Shenzhen
                Institute of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) with Spacety Co., Ltd. KubeEdge brings in orbit-earth collaboration for
                the Tiansuan-1 Satellite in the platform, this integration has enabled new service scenarios such as image inference, incremental deep learning,
                and federated learning.

                China's highway electronic toll collection (ETC) system: KubeEdge has been instrumental in managing nearly 100,000 edge nodes and over 500,000
                edge applications in 29 of China's 34 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. With these applications, the system processes more than
                300 million data records daily and supports continuous updates of ETC services on highways. As a result, the time taken to pass through toll
                stations has been reduced from 29s to 3s for trucks, and from 15s to 2s for cars.

                Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao bridge: KubeEdge manages edge nodes deployed on the world's longest sea crossing bridge, which collects up to 14
                different types of sensor data, including light intensity, carbon dioxide, atmospheric pressure, noise, temperature, humidity, PM 2.5, PM 10,
                rain and snow, acceleration, angular velocity, Euler angle, magnetic field, and sound. It also enables business apps and device mapper and AI
                interference programs to be deployed at the edge.

                SAIC MAXUS MIFA 9: The next-generation car-cloud collaborative architecture, SAIC MAXUS full-size luxury, smart, pure electric MPV MIFA 9, has
                become the first-ever vehicle with KubeEdge Inside. This platform can manage 100,000+ nodes and millions of edge devices and is based on
                KubeEdge's capabilities such as lightweight architecture, optimized for unstable cloud-edge networks at scale, simplified heterogeneous IoT
                device management, and edge autonomy in the case of disconnection.

                CDN platform of China Telecom: KubeEdge is used to manage CDN edge nodes, automatically deploy and upgrade CDN edge services, and implement edge
                service disaster recovery (DR) when migrating CDN services to the cloud.

                China Mobile On-line Marketing Service Center: The largest call center in the world, with 44,000 agents, 900 million users, and 53 customer
                service centers, builds a cloud-edge synergy architecture consisting of two centers and multiple edges based on KubeEdge.

                Xinghai IoT: This IoT company provides comprehensive smart building solutions by leveraging a construction IoT platform, intelligent hardware,
                and AI. Xinghai IoT built a smart campus with cloud-edge-device synergy based on KubeEdge and its own Xinghai IoT cloud platform, greatly
                improving the efficiency of campus management. With AI assistance, nearly 30% of the repetitive work is automated.

                SF Express: The largest integrated logistics service provider in China and the fourth largest in the world, completely transformed their supply
                chains by implementing KubeEdge. The smart supply chain system enables edge-cloud synergy, edge data collection, real-time edge data processing,
                massive IoT device management, and creates a more stable, secure, and reliable edge industrial IoT system.

It will obtain certificates from a variety of Issuers, both popular public Issuers as well as private Issuers, and ensure the certificates are valid and up-to-date, and will attempt to renew certificates at a configured time before expiry."
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                Manual certificate management is an outage waiting to happen; it only takes one forgotten renewal to bring down an entire site. Automation is
                therefore key to reliability, and cert-manager is the foremost tool for achieving this in Kubernetes. In addition, workloads such as service
                meshes can require local certificate authorities, and cert-manager can help in issuing and controlling these key parts of infrastructure.

                Falco is a cloud-native runtime security project that makes it easy to consume kernel events. Falco enriches these events with additional
                information from the Kubernetes platform and ecosystem as well as the rest of the cloud native stack. Falco can also be extended to other data
                sources through the use of plugins. Falco offers a rich set of security rules designed for Kubernetes, Linux, and cloud native environments.
                When a rule is violated in the system, Falco alerts users with details about the violation and severity.
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                You can think about Falco as a security camera for containers, Kubernetes and the cloud: it collects signals from hosts, containers,
                orchestrators and cloud logs, and it reports suspicious or anomalous behavior. Falco provides kernel instrumentation mechanisms to detect
                security events. It then enriches them with metadata pulled from the node, the container runtime and Kubernetes. This metadata is then used to
                dynamically apply Falco rules based on the container name, image, orchestrator labels, orchestrator resource type, etc.

                Keycloak is an Open-Source Identity and Access Management Solution for Modern Applications and Services. The project is primarily designed to
                make it easy  for developers to secure their applications with minimal effort.

                Keycloak builds on top of industry security standard protocols supporting OAuth2, OpenID Connect, WebAuthn. It also empowers administrators and
                users,  providing an extensive and friendly interface to configure and manage Keycloak. Existing security infrastructure like SAML2 based IdPs,
                LDAP servers,  Kerberos/SPNEGO, custom user storage solutions are easy to integrate while making their presence transparent to applications and
                end users.

                Keycloak provides fully customizable login pages, strong authentication, support for password recovery, client secret rotation, recovery codes
                for 2FA,  terms and conditions, step-up authentication, and a lot more. All of this without any need for coding at all. All pages visible to
                users support custom themes, making  it easy to modify the look and feel of the pages to integrate with your corporate branding and existing
                applications.
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                Keycloak provides built-in cloud-native identity and access control standards. By delegating the security aspects of an application to
                Keycloak,  developers don't need to worry about different authentication mechanisms, understand about cryptography, or how to safely store
                passwords.

                Developers can take advantage of modern authentication and authorization protocols like OAuth2, OpenID Connect, WebAuthn, SAML2 based IDPs, LDAP
                servers, Kerberos/SPNEGO.

                Keycloak enables infrastructure teams and cloud-native developers to secure their cloud-native stack technologies through consolidated security
                standards, to provide to users a cloud-friendly experience with a strong focus on usability, scalability, and security.

                Kubewarden is a Policy Engine powered by WebAssembly policies. Its policies can be written in CEL, Rego (OPA & Gatekeeper flavours), Rust, Go, YAML,

              summary_business_use_case: >-
                Embracing WebAssembly for policies means that Policy Authors can use their preferred tooling (language libraries, Git, CI);
                thus lowering knowledge barrier and silos, reducing training, and minimizing ad-hoc solutions.
                Thanks to policies being WebAssembly, Kubewarden policies can leverage and reuse upstream libraries to expand on current policy solutions while
                keeping compatibility (e.g: its cel-policy uses Kubernetes' cel-go interpreter, its kyverno-policy compiles a subset of Kyverno codebase to
                support Kyverno's YAML-like DSL). 
                Kubewarden policy CRDs and PolicyServer CRD enable insulation of consumers per namespace, and self-service.

              testing, image  control, container deployment, container operation, etc. Shangfu also integrates security with development which means providing
              feedback of the  application security condition through correlating operation asset, and promoting the iteration and upgrade of application.
              Whereupon, a closed  loop of efficient cloud native application security risk is created, covering the whole stages of DevSecOps.

              summary_use_case: >
                The Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone (SPIFFE) Project defines a framework and set of standards for identifying and securing
                communications between application services. At its core, SPIFFE is:


                A standard defining how services identify themselves to each other. These are called SPIFFE IDs and are implemented as Uniform Resource
                Identifiers (URIs).


                A standard for encoding SPIFFE IDs in a cryptographically-verifiable document called a SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document or SVIDs.


                An API specification for issuing and/or retrieving SVIDs. This is the Workload API.


                The SPIFFE Project has a reference implementation, the SPIRE (the SPIFFE Runtime Environment), that in addition to the above, it:


                - Performs node and workload attestation.


                - Implements a signing framework for securely issuing and renewing SVIDs.


                - Provides an API for registering nodes and workloads, along with their designated SPIFFE IDs.


                - Provides and manages the rotation of keys and certs for mutual authentication and encryption between workloads.


                - Simplifies access from identified services to secret stores, databases, services meshes and cloud provider services.


                - Interoperability and federation to SPIFFE compatible systems across heterogeneous environments and administrative trust boundaries


                The SPIFFE Workload API can attest running software systems and issue SPIFFE IDs and SVIDs to them. This in turn allows two workloads to
                establish trust between each other, for example by establishing an mTLS connection or by signing and verifying a JWT token. Use of SPIFFE can
                also enable workloads to securely authenticate to a secret store, a database, or a cloud provider service.
              summary_business_use_case: >
                In today's business environment, rapidly delivering innovative customer experiences through differentiated applications and services is
                necessary for competitive advantage. As a result, organizations witness a change in how applications and services are being architected, built,
                and deployed. New technologies such as cloud and containers help organizations release faster, at scale. Services need to be built at high
                velocity and deployed on a vast plethora of platforms. As development accelerates, these systems are becoming increasingly interdependent and
                interconnected to deliver a consistent customer experience.


                Organizations may be inhibited in achieving high velocity and gaining market share or mission assurance for such major reasons as compliance,
                the pool of expertise, and interoperability challenges between teams/organizations and within existing solutions.


                For business leaders focused on improving business expediency and returns, SPIFFE can significantly reduce costs associated with the overhead of
                managing and issuing cryptographic identity documents (e.g. X.509 certificates), and accelerate development and deployment by removing the need
                for developers to understand the identity and authentication technologies required to secure service-to-service communication.


                Technology integration as a result of organizational convergence can be a challenge when different technology stacks must come together and
                interoperate. Aligning on a common, industry-accepted standard for system-to-system communication with identity and authentication, simplifies
                the technical aspects of full interoperability and integration across multiple stacks.


                SPIFFE brings a shared understanding of what constitutes software identity. By further leveraging SPIFFE Federation, components in disparate
                systems in different organizations or teams can establish trust to communicate securely without the added overhead of constructs such as VPN
                tunnels, one-o certificates, or shared credentials for use between such systems.

              summary_personas: Kubernetes users who need persistent storage in their cluster.
              summary_tags: kubernetes, storage, csi, backup
              summary_use_case: >-
                * Highly available persistent storage for Kubernetes

                In the past, ITOps and DevOps have found it hard to add replicated storage to Kubernetes clusters. As a result many non-cloud-hosted Kubernetes
                clusters don’t support persistent storage. External storage arrays are non-portable and can be extremely expensive.

                Longhorn delivers simplified, easy to deploy and upgrade, 100% open source, cloud-native persistent block storage without the cost overhead of
                open core or proprietary alternatives.

                * Easy incremental snapshots and backups

                Longhorn’s built-in incremental snapshot and backup features keep the volume data safe in or out of the Kubernetes cluster.

                Scheduled backups of persistent storage volumes in Kubernetes clusters is simplified with Longhorn’s intuitive, free management UI.

                * Cross-cluster disaster recovery

                External replication solutions will recover from a disk failure by re-replicating the entire data store. This can take days, during which time
                the cluster performs poorly and has a higher risk of failure.

                Using Longhorn, you can control the granularity to the maximum, easily create a disaster recovery volume in another Kubernetes cluster, and
                failover to it in the event of an emergency.

                If your main cluster fails, you can bring up the app in the DR cluster quickly with a defined RPO and RTO.
              summary_business_use_case: Anyone running a stateful workload, like database, kafka, elasticsearch etc, in a Kubernetes cluster.
              summary_release_rate: 1.0 GA released on May 2020. Latest v1.4.0 was released on Dec 2022.
              summary_integration: With Kubernetes via CSI.

                 Rook is an open source cloud-native storage orchestrator, providing the platform, framework, and support for Ceph storage to integrate with cloud-native environments natively.
                 Ceph is a distributed storage system that provides block, file, and object storage and is deployed in large-scale production clusters.
                 Rook automates deployment and management of Ceph to provide self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services. The Rook operator builds on Kubernetes resources to deploy, configure, provision, scale, upgrade, and monitor Ceph.
                 The storage cluster can be run hyper-converged beside your applications, in a cloud, or on bare metal. Rook provides a consistent storage platform anywhere Kubernetes runs.
              summary_business_use_case: |2-
                 Rook provides a consistent storage platform, whether in the cloud or on bare metal. The storage cluster is managed through Kubernetes Custom Resources, making integrating with your existing DevOps/ GitOps toolset easy.
                 For your applications to consume storage, they simply need to use the Kubernetes native approach of creating a `PersistentVolumeClaim`.
                 Running a Rook Ceph cluster is made accessible due to the operator pattern.
                 The operator pattern allows the Rook project to handle most tasks automatically (e.g., updating to a new Ceph version). These automatic processes reduce the time spent setting up, configuring, maintaining, and updating your Rook storage cluster.

                CRI-O is a secure, performant, and stable Container Runtime Interface (CRI) implementation for the Kubelet to orchestrate Open Container
                Initiative (OCI) containers in production Kubernetes environments. CRI-O's scope is only targeted at Kubernetes, and thus can be performance
                optimized, rigorously tested and securely tuned for running containers, pods and images in Kubernetes clusters.
              summary_business_use_case: >
                CRI-O  is able to tune its behavior to that of the Kubelet, enabling features and performance gains through customization. It is tested against
                a suite of thousands of tests, including the suite of Kubernetes e2e tests, to ensure compatibility with Kubernetes workloads. It has long had
                security on the forefront of its design philosophy, enabling new security knobs and reducing the attack surface for the purposes of running
                containers in production.

                WasmEdge provides a high-performance, lightweight, secure, and extensible WebAssembly runtime for cloud-native applications. It is an OCI
                compliant container that is integrated into Docker, containerd, crun and many Kubernetes projects.  Compared with traditional Linux container
                apps, WasmEdge apps are more secure, more portable, cold-start 100x faster and only take 1/10 of the space.
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                WasmEdge improves cloud app’s operational efficiency by providing a secure, portable, fast, and lightweight alternative to traditional Linux
                containers. It allows microservice or servelsss applications to “scale to zero” — all computing resources can be made available on-demand, and
                “write once run anywhere”. It also works with existing container management infra and programming languages, and hence minimizing the cost of
                adoption and migration. It is great for running microservices and serverless functions embedded in data pipelines or SaaS platforms.

                Cilium is a networking, observability, and security platform based on eBPF. As a CNI, it provides a flat Layer 3 network, even across clusters.
                Cilium enforces network policies on L3-L7 using an identity based security model.


                Cilium implements distributed load balancing between pods and to external services by replacing kube-proxy. It also has advanced functionality
                like ingress and egress gateway, bandwidth management, service mesh, and deep network and security observability through Hubble and Tetragon.
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                Cilium reduces the operational complexity and cost of running highly scalable and dynamic cloud native environments. By leveraging eBPF, Cilium
                accelerates and simplifies service connectivity, makes systems observable for easier monitoring and debugging, and provides deep security
                observability and runtime enforcement.

                Within a singular cluster, the Capsule Controller seamlessly consolidates multiple namespaces into an efficient construct known as a "Tenant".
                This tenant acts as a unified group of Kubernetes Namespaces. Inside each tenant, users possess the autonomy to establish their own namespaces
                and utilize the entirety of designated resources. This design facilitates the creation of a multi-tenant ecosystem within a single Kubernetes
                cluster.  Not only can tenants be distinctly separated for enhanced operational management, but it also ensures the cluster remains singular,
                streamlining  maintenance processes. The end result? Heightened operational efficiency for administrators and significant cost savings for the
                business.

                K8GB is a powerful tool for managing global Kubernetes deployments and provides features such as load balancing, failover, and intelligent
                routing. K8GB works by creating a set of custom resource definitions (CRDs) in the Kubernetes cluster, which define the global traffic routing
                policies. These policies are used by K8GB to configure the DNS servers to route traffic to the appropriate cluster or region.

                K8GB (Kubernetes Global Balancer) is an open-source project that provides a global traffic management solution for Kubernetes clusters. It is
                designed to simplify the configuration and management of DNS-based traffic routing for multi-cluster and multi-region Kubernetes deployments. It
                makes Kubernetes-based applications resistant to regional-wide failures.

              summary_use_case: >-
                Emissary-Ingress is a k8s-native, Envoy-based API gateway. It is designed to allow teams to work in a more decentralized way than the
                traditional Ingress object. Emissary-Ingress can scan for its CRDs across all namespaces, so development teams can deploy new network routing
                rules along with the apps that use them, increasing velocity. Emissary-Ingress can be extended via API calls with authentication and rate
                limiting services. It is compatible with all the CNCF service meshes, and facilitates canary deployments when integrated with Argo Rollouts.
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                Emissary-Ingress speeds up deployment time and reduces the burden on platform teams by empowering developers to deploy new routes in a
                self-service manner. Platform/cloud teams can centrally manage hosts and certificates while developers can manage the resources relevant to
                them.

                Aeraki Mesh has been created to provide a non-intrusive, highly extendable way to manage any layer-7 traffic in a service mesh, including Dubbo,
                Thrift, bRPC, Redis, etc., and private protocols as well.
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                While service mesh becomes an important infrastructure for microservices, many(if not all) service mesh implementations mainly focus on HTTP
                protocols and treat other protocols as plain TCP traffic. This is an obstacle for a lot of organizations when they try to leverage service
                mesh's promised capablities to simplify their microservice development and operation. Aeraki Mesh solve this problem by providing a common
                layer-7 service mesh framework both in data plane and control plane, which is built on top of Envoy and Istio and can work with them together
                very well.

                userver solves the problem of efficient I/O interactions transparently for the developers. As a result, with the framework you get
                straightforward source code, avoid CPU-consuming context switches from OS, efficiently utilize the CPU with a small amount of execution threads.

                Contains efficient asynchronous drivers for databases (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, ClickHouse, YDB, MySQL/MariaDB...); data transfer protocols (HTTP,
                gRPC, AMQP 0-9-1, TCP, TLS, WebSocket ...), tasks construction and cancellation; high-level components for caches, tasks, distributed locking,

                Deliver reliable and efficient applications in a few lines of code. The framework provides APIs that hide away I/O callbacks complexity, leading
                to simple linear code that is easy to write and maintain. By using userver in your application, you adopt best practices of high avaialability
                servicecs without having to spend time solving common challenges like exponential backoff retry policies, deadline propagarions, metrics and
                tracings.

                The Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr) provides APIs that simplify microservice architecture development and increases developer
                productivity. Whether your communication pattern is service-to-service invocation or pub/sub messaging, Dapr helps you write resilient and
                secured microservices. By letting Dapr’s sidecar take care of the complex challenges such as service discovery, message broker integration,
                encryption, observability, and secret management, developers can focus on business logic and keep their code simple.
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                Deliver distributed system applications in half the time. Dapr provides APIs that abstract away the complexity of common challenges developers
                encounter regularly when building distributed applications. These API building blocks can be leveraged as the need arises - use one, several, or
                all to develop applications faster and deliver solutions on time. Dapr leverages proven practices for distributed application development that
                enable developers to build resilient, secured systems. By using Dapr in your application, you adopt these best practices without having to spend
                time solving common challenges.

                Kapeta will automate and accelerate your entire software development lifecycle. This is made
                                possible by defining your software components as lego-like building blocks, and then using these
                                building blocks to define your software system. Kapeta then knows all it needs to know to generate code,
                                devcontainers, and eventually deploy. Think of it as an internal developer platform (iDP) on steroids.
              summary_business_use_case: |-
                Create and implement any software system securely, privately and at record speed - and save
                                costs on infrastructure and operations through automated optimization. You do the special sauce -
                                Kapeta does the rest.
                                And once your done - explain the system to non-technical people easily through the visual system map.

                Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of configuration (like Git repositories and OCI artifacts), and automating
                updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy. Flux is built from the ground up to use Kubernetes' API extension system, and to
                integrate with Prometheus and other core components of the Kubernetes ecosystem. Flux supports multi-tenancy and support for syncing an
                arbitrary number of Git repositories, among other long-requested features.
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                GitOps is the natural evolution of configuration as code. Businesses moving to Flux can deal with infrastructure at scale more easily, and allow
                their developers to focus on code, not on deployment problems. With its vast ecosystem of Flux integrations and being integrated into cloud
                offerings everywhere, adopting Flux can be adopted in virtually every setup.

                Keptn supports teams that build their next generation platform on Kubernetes by solving the following 3 major challenges:
                1: Tame observability tool complexity: Keptn unifies access to ALL observability data through a single metrics server
                2: Remove complex delivery pipeline logic: Keptn provides deployment lifecycle tasks natively in Kubernetes
                3: Root cause for deploy change impact: Keptn emits end-2-end telemetry data to understand and troubleshoot deployments
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                Engineering teams want to have flexibility and choose the best tool for their needs, creating complex pipelines that are hard to control and
                maintain. Using Keptn, teams can focus on the application code and forget about Deployment complexity and tool integration. Similarly, SREs can
                enforce their SLOs/SLAs at the application and microservice levels.
