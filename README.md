# Cloud Native Landscape Project

The [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io) Cloud Native Landscape
Project attempts to categorize many of the most popular projects and
startups in the cloud native space. It is under development by
[CNCF](https://www.cncf.io), [Redpoint](https://www.redpoint.com/)
and [Amplify](http://www.amplifypartners.com).

Suggestions for improvements are welcome. Please open an
[issue](https://github.com/cncf/landscape/issues/new). [Similar to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest), we ask that you don't submit a tool that you yourself work on or have financial stake in.
